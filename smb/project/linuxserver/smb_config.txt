# Comments are introduced by a '#' character

# A config file is broken up into sections.  Valid sections include
# global, ipc, share, printer, group, and user.
#
# Each section is processed as the file is read.  So, it is best to specify
# all shares first, then users and a global.


# The ipc section has only one optional variable, password.  This
# controls the password needed to get a list of available shares on
# the server.  If the password is unspecified, no password is needed.

[ipc]
[end]


# A share section will set up a file share's availability.  There can be many share
# sections.  Each share uses the default file system.  The following options are available:
#
# name : The share's name as it appears in Network Neighborhood
# comment : The share's comment  (optional)
# path : The directory to share
# flags : Configurable options for share.  Valid flags are dos_names,
# 	case_sensitive, and create
#		dos_names : This enforces 8.3 syntax to filenames
#		case_sensitive : The filesystem is case sensitive
#		create : The path will be created if it doesn't exist
# 	The default for all of these is off.  Adding the flag names in a
# 	space-delimited line turns the options on.
# permission : The permission granted to users who specify the correct
# 	share password.  This is only used when the server is in share mode.
# password : The password for share mode.  If omitted, no password is needed.

[share]
name = share0
comment = native fs
# path = /media
path = /home/peter/smbtest

# Printer shares are defined by [printer] sections.
#
# It has all the same variables as the [share] section, except for a few changes.
# There isn't a permission variable, since that is not customizable for a printer,
# and there are a few additional configuration parameters.  The reason you need to
# set up all the share variables is that each printer must
# have some filesystem space for its temporary files.
#
# The unique variables:
#
# number : the number of the port the printer is connected to, 1-based.
#		(i.e. parallel port 0 is number = 1)
# drivername : the name of the driver to use (you have to know correct string)
#       This is the same as the string Windows uses to describe the driver.

# A group section will register a group to which users can belong.  The group
# concept is invisible to the user.  It is only included to make administration
# easier.  There can be many group sections.  The valid variables are name and shares.
#
# name : Specify the name of the group.
# shares : A space-delimited list of shares and permissions.  The syntax is as
# 	follows: share:permissions
#	For example, if a share is called "music" and you wanted to give this
# 	group write only access to it, you would say music:wo.  If you also wanted
#	to give this group read-write access to the share "books," you could say
#	"music:wo books:rw".
#		The valid permission flags are
#			ro : read only
#			wo : write only
#			rw : read and write
# 		If you omit a share:permission pair, or type "share:" (e.g. "music:")
#       with no permissions, access is none.
#   When a permission is set to write only, the user can still browse the listings
#   of files, but cannot read any of them.  Therefore, they can only upload files,
#   and can't download them.
#
#   When a permission is set to read only, the user can still browse the listings and
#   view the contents of files, but cannot delete, create, or modify any files on the
#   share.
#
#	Under almost any circumstance, you will want to grant every group read
#	and write access to the ipc$ share (this allows them to browse the list of
#	available shares).

# A user section sets up a user with a name, password, and group designations.
# Valid variables are name, password, and groups.
#
# name : User name.  This is not case sensitive.
# password : Password for user.  If omitted, user needs none.
# groups : Space-delimited list of groups user belongs to.  This user will have
# 	the most favorable access to any given share that any one of his or her
# 	groups allows.

# The global section has three variables:  mode, guest, and guestgroups.
# If mode is set to "user", user-mode authentication will occur.
# If mode is set to "share", share-based authentication will occur.
# The default is share.
#
# If guest is set to "yes", a guest account will be created that will be used if a
# user does not have a username.
#
# If guest is set to "yes", then guestgroups will be a space-delimited list of groups
# guest belongs to and the permissions.  See the user section above for specifics
# on the syntax.
#
# You only need one global section.
